\TUchapter{Discrete Extensions}
\TUsection{Introduction}
The adaptation of the attack graph formalism described in
the preceding chapter for hybrid purposes depends upon the addition of a number
of entirely discrete elements. Their inclusion produces a transitional
attack graph formalism that is not yet appropriate for hybrid modeling but that
contains a number of enhancements to discrete system modeling.

This chapter introduces these enhancements, which include a working lexicon of
standard terms for topologies and qualities based upon the Common Vulnerability
Enumeration and National Vulnerability Database~\cite{nvdhome}; some syntactic
changes to ease the modeling of information systems;
mechanisms for grouping attacks; and a scheme for integrating with
the Common Platform Enumeration~\cite{buttner2009common}.

\TUsection{Working Lexicon}
\TUsubsection{Introduction}
Because of the unrestricted nature of the attack graph specification language, 
some conventions must be established in order to proceed systematically. This
thesis recommends
a set of conventions designed to ease automated exploit pattern extraction
from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) maintained by the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which among other roles
indexes MITRE's Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE).
\TUsubsection{National Vulnerability Database}
Two vulnerability properties catalogued by the NVD inform this lexicon:
\emph{access vector} and \emph{impact type}.
\TUsubsubsection{Access vector}
The access vector of a vulnerability on NVD refers to the logical location from
which the attacker may launch the attack. The possible attack vectors according
to the National Vulnerability Database are as follows.
\begin{description}
\item[Local] The vulnerability is exploitable through physical or local account access
    to the device on which the vulnerability resides.
\item[Adjacent Network] The vulnerability is exploitable through access to a network
    that is adjacent to the vulnerable host; that is, the attacker must be in the same
    broadcast domain or collision domain (e.g. the same network segment or VLAN).
\item[Network] No local or adjacent access is required to exploit the vulnerability;
    in other words, it is exploitable over the Internet.
\end{description}
\TUsubsubsection{Impact Type}
The vulnerability's impact type on NVD places the effects of the vulnerability's
exploitation on the target into one of the following categories.
\begin{description}
\item[Confidentiality] Confidentiality impacts allow the unauthorized disclosure 
    of information
\item[Integrity] Allows modification of data
\item[Availability] Availability impacts correspond to disruptions of service
\item[Security Protection] The security protection category refers to the effects
    of exploits that provide unauthorized access to the target. This may be either
    general system access or application access. It has three subcategories:
    \begin{description}
    \item[User access] The attacker gains user level access to the operating 
        system.
    \item[Administrative access] The attacker gains root level
        access to the operating system.
    \item[Other access] The attacker gains any other type of access (e.g. to
        a service account).
    \end{description}
\end{description}
\TUsubsection{Topologies}
Introduction of actual terms begins with topologies, but first a note about the modeling
of adversaries is needed. 

Two approaches are possible for modeling the attacker. The first
is to model the network from the attacker's perspective.
In this scheme, henceforth the \emph{first person} strategy, the attacker is treated as
implicit, and its access and connections are qualities.
The adversary's access level to a server, for instance, would be modeled as a quality of
that server asset.

In the second approach, henceforth the \emph{third person} strategy, the attacker is
modeled as an element of the system. Its properties, connections,
and access levels are modeled as qualities and topologies of the adversary asset.
This strategy, which is employed in this thesis and lexicon, can model multiple
adversaries with varying capabilities in a single model. Aside from that 
difference, they are roughly equivalent, and their selection is a matter
of taste.

This section introduces two types of topologies: connection and access,
corresponding respectively to access vector and security protection impact
subtype.
\TUsubsubsection{Connection Topologies}
Connection topologies refer to how two assets are connected, over the network or otherwise.
As with NVD access vectors, they may be local, adjacent, or network connected. These connection topologies begin with
the word \texttt{connected}, followed by an underscore, then one of the three connection
types: \texttt{local}, \texttt{adjacent}, or \texttt{network}. For local and adjacent
connections, this is all that is necessary. 

For network connections, protocols and services are specified explicitly and 
individually by appending another underscore, then the lower case version of 
the standard abbreviation for the protocol
(e.g. \texttt{connected\_network\_http} for web or \texttt{connected\_network\_ssh} for
secure shell).

Connections are one-way: the source of the connection topology is the
``client'', and the destination is
the ``server'', where such distinctions are meaningful.
\TUsubsubsection{Access Topologies}
Access topologies refer to trust relationships and distinguish what kind of access one
asset has
to another. Much like the subcategories of the Security Protection impact type,
there are three basic types of access topology: user access,
root access, and other access.

They are named using the word \texttt{access}, an underscore, 
and the lowercase name of the access type. If the access type is \texttt{other},
an optional underscore delimited description of the access type (e.g. the name 
of the service). Examples include
\texttt{access\_user}, \texttt{access\_root}, \texttt{access\_other\_apache}, or
\texttt{access\_other\_vsftp}.
\TUsubsection{Qualities}
Although qualities are used in a more \emph{ad hoc} fashion to describe entity-specific
asset properties, there is still a role for a standard quality structure in the
lexicon, namely a simple ``status'' type of property to be used in determining
whether an asset is enabled or disabled.
\TUsubsubsection{Status}
The status property is simple but powerful. Each asset that represents a host has a
quality named \texttt{status} with the value \texttt{up} or \texttt{down}.
This allows exploits to require that an asset
be online as a precondition or to implement denial of service attacks with
\texttt{status = down} quality postconditions.

\TUsection{Syntactic Sugar}
\TUsubsection{Directional Topologies}
This section introduces new notation for topologies. As it
is common to model bidirectional topologies, an additional convenience syntax
is now permitted to specify the directionality of a topology. As before, 
topologies are specified by the word~\texttt{topology}, a colon, 
and asset names; however, in the new syntax,
they are separated by a directionality symbol:~\texttt{->} to 
represent a one-way topology
or~\texttt{<->} to represent a two-way topology. To promote readability,
~\texttt{<-} is not recognized.

Furthermore, the model has no innate distinction between one-way and two-way
topologies except the \texttt{<->} shorthand for specifying symmetric topologies.
That is to say, a bidirectional topology fact is actually implemented as
two unidirectional topology facts. If a bidirectional
topology exists in the fact base, one of its component directional topologies may
be removed without affecting its reverse.
\TUsubsection{Value Assignment}
In preparation for the introduction of real-valued facts, the existing discrete
qualities, henceforth called ``token valued'', are given a special
assignment operator. Simply put, token values are both assigned and tested
for equality using the~\texttt{=} operator; they may also be tested 
for inequality with the~\texttt{!=} operator.

Additionally, \texttt{delete} operations in postconditions take only a quality
name, with no value required (eliminating the confusing possibility of a
command to \texttt{delete quality:a,q!=5}, one of several deletion commands
that has little meaning).
\TUsubsection{Host Declaration and Status Preprocessing}
To support the use of status properties of host assets, a set of shorthand
syntax is now provided for denoting which assets represent hosts. In practice,
this has been observed to be the majority of modeled assets, so the shorthand
is highly convenient for modelers. Host denotation and status processing is 
done in two places: in the declaration of assets, and in the parameter list of 
exploits.

In the asset list declaration, up hosts are denoted by prefixing their name with
the symbol~\texttt{@}, a signal to the host preprocessor to automatically add
the \texttt{quality:hostname,status=up} fact; and down hosts are denoted with
the~\texttt{!@} symbol, automatically adding the down host quality fact.

Similarly, in exploit parameter lists, asset parameters that must have the
up status precondition are declared by prefixing their names with the up host 
symbol~\texttt{@}; likewise down with the symbol~\texttt{!@}. If no host
status preconditions are required, no symbol is needed. The host status
preprocessor automatically adds the required preconditions; if a host status
postcondition is necessary, for example in the case of a denial of service
attack bringing a host offline, the status property must be manually specified;
this is not a significant burden, as this case arises considerably less
frequently.
\TUsection{Global and grouped exploits}
For a variety of modeling tasks, it is convenient to cause an exploit to be
fired on all possible bindings simultaneously or to synchronize multiple 
exploits. Two optional keywords are now permitted at the beginning
of the exploit header for this purpose: \texttt{global} and \texttt{group()}.
The \texttt{group} keyword takes a single string argument, the group name.

Their behavior
is as follows. When a global exploit is fired on one binding of assets, it will
also be fired on all other assets for which a valid binding exists, and the
corresponding state transition will be considered a single edge on the attack
graph. When a group exploit is fired on a binding of assets, all other exploits
denoted with the group keyword and the same group argument will also attempt
to fire on the same asset binding. Obviously grouped exploits require the same
number of parameters; naming the parameters the same is highly recommended but
not strictly required.

Two \emph{caveats} are required with global and grouped exploits. The first
is that a group may not mix global and nonglobal exploits. If mixing of
nonglobals and globals were permitted within a single group, the result would
be behavior that is compatible with neither the concept of a group or the
concept of a global (a group requires that each single attack binding be made
to all exploits within the group, whereas a global requires every possible
attack binding be made simultaneously).

The second warning is that no consistency checking is specified. That is,
preconditions are checked against a predecessor state, then postconditions
are applied in arbitrary order. This means that if multiple attacks in a group
modify the same facts on the same assets, indeterminate behavior or race
conditions may occur. For this reason, it is advised to group only exploits that
whose preconditions guard against this possibility.
\TUsection{Platform Properties}
Platform facts are new types of facts introduced by this work. They use the
specification used by MITRE's Common Platform Enumeration 
(CPE)~\cite{buttner2009common}, a component
of the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).
They can specify operating systems, applications, and hardware.

A CPE platform fact is simply a valid CPE URI tied to an asset. The CPE URI
takes the following form, all of which is optional.

\texttt{cpe:/part:vendor:product:version:update:edition:language}

For example, to specify that a host is running Adobe Reader version 8.1, a 
platform fact named \texttt{cpe:/a:adobe:reader:8.1} would be used. Platforms
are matched according to the algorithms provided in the CPE specification,
permitting blank (wildcard) fields and a prefix property.
\TUsection{Generation process changes}
These new capabilities require some adjustments to the semantic behavior of the
attack graph generation generation process. Happily, the attack graph generation
algorithm itself is unchanged, although more sophisticated fact handling,
both for precondition processing and postcondition application,
is required. This section discusses these changes.
\TUsubsection{Bidirectional topologies}
The addition of bidirectional topologies introduces a new requirement for
parsing or precondition/postcondition analysis: that single bidirectional 
topology facts be decomposed into pairs
of unidirectional topologies. In the reference implementation, this is done
not in the initial parse itself but rather in the portion of fact handling that
converts the raw parsed data structure into the generator's internal fact
data structure.
\TUsubsection{Platform properties}
The new platform properties introduce another set of conditional logic to
precondition processing. Since there are no operators, precondition matching
is relatively simple syntactically; however, because of the prefix
property of its encoding and the ability to have blank ``wildcard'' fields
in the matched CPE, a matching algorithm must be used. The matching algorithm
in the reference implementation is based on the one provided in the CPE
specification~\cite{buttner2009common}.
The pseudocode for this thesis's platform fact matching functionality is
provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:cpe_match_pc}

% TODO: frames for listing figures???
\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
def has_platform(factbase_platformlist, platform):
 # Platform is a tuple
 for cpe in factbase_platformlist:
  if len(cpe) >= len(platform):
      ret = False
      for components in zip(cpe, platform):
       if components[0] == components[1] or platform == '':
        ret = True
       else:
        ret = False
        break
       if ret:
        return cpe # Return the matched platform
 return False
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Platform fact matching pseudocode}
\label{fig:cpe_match_pc}
\end{figure}
\TUsubsection{Precondition matching}
On the other hand, quality precondition matching must become
somewhat more complicated with the addition of the not-equal relational
operator. Merely building a fact and checking for its membership in the
fact base data structure is no longer sufficient. 

Although the not-equal relational operator \emph{could} be implemented
similarly to the equality relational operator, by building a fact from the
given name and value and checking for its exclusion from (instead of inclusion 
in) the fact base, a more advanced fact checking method is provided in order 
to ease the transition to permitting real values for qualities.

The fact base data structure is updated to include maps from quality names to
quality values in order to facilitate lookup. Although this redundancy results 
in an increased storage requirement, it prevents costly lookups in the existing
fact base. Fact checking, then, is done using these simple hash
table lookups and comparisons. A new specification for the network state
data structure reflecting these changes is provided in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:netstate_map_pc}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
fact-tuple = ('quality', asset, name, value) or
           = ('topology', source, dest, name) or
           = ('platform', platform_part, ..., language)

type network_state:
    assets : set of strings;
    factbase : set of fact-tuples;
    qualities : map (keys=assets, vals=map(keys=quality_name,
                                           vals=quality_value))
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Updated discrete network state data type pseudocode}
\label{fig:netstate_map_pc}
\end{figure}

\TUsubsection{Global and grouped exploits}
The simultaneous application of global and grouped exploits is also
fairly straightforward. Postcondition processing requires only the minor change
of permitting a list of postconditions to be processed sequentially (which
really only requires the union of their postcondition facts) using the
existing postcondition application method.

Precondition processing is more complex insofar as it causes the selection and
grouping of attacks that should be fed into the generation function,
each producing its own state transition. To permit
a reader to follow along, pseudocode is provided in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:cpe_glgr_precondition_pc}.

The reference implementation uses a two-pass algorithm over the set of
valid attacks (selected using the existing precondition processing method).
First, a trio of mappings are instantiated to store the attack data structures.
The ``grouped global'' map is keyed on group names and has as values a list of every
valid binding to all the attacks in the group.
The ``non-global group'' mapping is also keyed on group names and has as values more maps, which are
themselves keyed to tuples of assets (representing bindings values) and valued
with specific attack bindings. The ``non-grouped global'' mapping is keyed on exploit name
and also valued with attack bindings.

The first step is to loop through all the attacks. Attacks are placed in the
appropriate map (or maps) depending on their group (and binding) and global
configuration.

The second step is to use these maps to generate groupings of attacks, which
are to be applied by the postconditions processor in the same manner as single
attacks themselves are applied. First, each global group is inserted as its
own aggregated attack group. Second, groups and bindings are looped through. An
attack group is generated per binding per group name. Finally,
each remaining (that is, non-grouped) global exploit is
added as its own attack grouping. The collection of groupings is returned.

Note that, in spite of the nested for loops, each possible attack binding is
still processed at most twice.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
globl_group_dict = map keyed on group name
group_dict = map keyed on group name
globl_dict = map keyed on exploit name

for attack in attacks:
    group = attack.group
    globl = attack.globl
    binding = attack.binding.values # asset list
    
    if group and globl:
        if group in globl_group_dict:
            globl_group_dict[group].append(attack)
        else:
            globl_group_dict[group] = [attack,]
        continue

    if group:
        if group in group_dict and binding in group_dict[group]:
            group_dict[group][binding].append(attack)
        elif group in group_dict:
            group_dict[group][binding] = [attack,]
        else:
            group_dict[group] = new map{binding : [attack,]}
        continue
        
    if globl:
        if attack.name in globl_dict:
            globl_dict[attack.name].append(attack)
        else:
            globl_dict[attack.name] = [attack,]

agg_attacks = [] # Aggregated attacks, the goal of this code

for group_id in globl_group_dict: # Global groups:
    group_attacks = globl_group_dict[group_id]
    agg_attacks.append(globl_group_dict[group_id])

for group_id in group_dict: # Non-global groups:
    group_attacks = group_dict[group_id]
    for binding in group_attacks:
        agg_attacks.append(group_attacks[binding])

for globl_attack in globl_dict: # Non-grouped globals
    agg_attacks.append(list(globl_dict[globl_attack]))

\TUsubsection{Blunderdome}
This section presents an attack graph model of the Blunderdome exercise
described in section~\ref{sec:blunderdome}.
\TUsubsubsection{Network Model}
The network model for the Blunderdome exercise follows in a straightforward
manner from the network diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:blunderarch}), including each network
element as an asset, plus an asset for the attacker. The facts include the
attacker's grade on the web server, the SSH and HTTP connection topologies,
and platform facts for the relevant applications and operating systems subject
to exploitation: OpenSSL, Linux, and the Blunderdome specific grades tracking
application (which receives a dummy CPE entry).

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
network model = 
 assets :
  attacker;
  login_server;
  web_server;
    
 facts :
  quality:web_server,grade=F;
  topology:attacker->login_server,connected_network_ssh;
  topology:login_server->web_server,connected_network_http;
  platform:login_server,cpe:/a:openssl_project:openssl:0.9.8c-1;
  platform:login_server,cpe:/o:linux:kernel:2.6.24;
  platform:web_server,cpe:/a:isec:blundergrades;
.
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Blunderdome network model}
\label{fig:blunder_nm}
\end{figure}

In this model there are three access topologies in play: access\_admin,
access\_user, and access\_other\_blunderdome, representing access to the 
Blunderdome web application.
\TUsubsubsection{Exploit Patterns}
The exploits in the Blunderdome exercise, provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:blunder_xp}
fall into three categories. The first is the set of straightforward CVE-based exploits
that could be extracted automatically from the National Vulnerability
Database. The second is the set of hand generated exploits like blunder\_sqli
which has custom behavior to modify the attacker's grade. The third is the set
of exploit patterns that do not necessarily represent abuse cases 
but rather state transitions due to attacker actions.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
exploit CVE_2008_0166_1(a, l)=
 preconditions:
  platform:l,cpe:/a:openssl_project:openssl:0.9.8c-1;
  topology:a->l,connected_network_ssh;
 postconditions:
  insert topology:a->l,access_user;
.

exploit CVE_2008_0600_1(a,l)=
 preconditions:
  topology:a->l,access_user;
  platform:l,cpe:/o:linux:kernel:2.6.24;
 postconditions:
  insert topology:a->l,access_admin;
.

exploit blunder_sqli(a,w)=
 preconditions:
  platform:w,cpe:/a:isec:blundergrades;
  topology:a->w,access_other_blunderdome;
 postconditions:
  insert quality:w,grade=A;
.

exploit ssh_http_tunnel(a,l,w)=
 preconditions:
  topology:a->l,connected_network_ssh;
  topology:a->l,access_user;
  topology:l->w,connected_network_http;
 postconditions:
  insert topology:a->w,connected_network_http;
.

exploit blunder_login(a,l,w)=
 preconditions:
  topology:a->w,connected_network_http;
  topology:a->l,access_admin;
 postconditions:
  insert topology:a->w,access_other_blunderdome;
.
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Blunderdome exploit patterns}
\label{fig:blunder_xp}
\end{figure}

The first two exploits could be automatically generated from the CVE entries
in the NVD. The third was hand generated due to its being an internal custom 
piece of software without NVD entries and the complex behavior the exploit must
encode.

The next exploit, ssh\_http\_tunnel, represents a common idiom involved in
attack chaining: using access to one machine to ``pivot'' and create new access topologies
to adjacent machines. The last exploit, blunder\_login, represents access to
the Blunderdome credentials due to administrative access to the login
server.

The resulting attack graph is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:blunder_ag}; the
graphical representation of the starting state and ending state in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:blunder_s0} and Fig.~\ref{fig:blunder_s6}.
