\TUchapter{Hybrid Extensions}
\TUsection{Introduction}
An objective of this thesis is to make the first known foray into the realm of
attack graphs with real-valued components. This chapter introduces the additional
modeling syntax and generation semantics required to permit real values for
qualities and topologies. Furthermore, some initial attempts at representing
the passage of time are described. 

Some of the requirements that this new hybrid scheme places on the modeler
have turned out to be more onerous than desired. However, since the use of 
attack graphs on hybrid systems with real valued properties is quite nascent, 
being introduced in this thesis, there is a significant contribution to their
study even in introducing less than ideal solutions to their inherent problems.
