As computer systems' interactions with the physical world become more pervasive,
largely in safety critical domains, the need for tools to model and study the security
of these so-called cyber physical systems is growing. This thesis presents extensions
to the attack graph modeling framework to permit the modeling of continuous, in addition
to discrete, system elements and their interactions, to provide a comprehensive
formal modeling framework for describing cyber physical systems and their security properties.
